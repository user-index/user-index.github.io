			<p>Welcome to our site! This is a personal blog ran by <a href="pages/aboutus.html#grape">grapetoast</a> and <a href="pages/aboutus.html#ty">ty</a>. The site itself is rather new, so there is plenty more content and changes to come. We hope you find our thoughts interesting! Enjoy your stay ^-^</p>

			<p>Heya kids! You may have noticed our site was down for a little while. That's because life is hard. Which prevented me from being able to do fix the server that I may or may not have destroyed...<br><br> Anywho! Life is pain, and currently grape and ty are on their longest streak of not touching lips in meatspace since becoming bros who exchange bodily fluids. It has been rough :( Speaking of rough, router problems, amirite. Currently having trouble with my piece of soykaf verizon box. That is why user-index is currently being hosted on github pages. This is temporary cuz we can only host static pages, which means the guestbook is currently down. If you would like to reach out to us yall can shoot us an <a href="mailto:user-index@protonmail.com">email :)</a><br><br>
			Thats all, we're back, feel fear. <3 AND CHECK OUT GRAPES SUPER COOL ART CLICK LINK ABOVE!!!</p>
			<h3><a href="img/felixty.png">Picture of Admins</a></h3>
			<p>Today grape and I were talking on the web. I wanted to show her some holiday cookies my grandma sent, unfortunately I eated it. Anywho while we were talking she showed me some cool <a href="https://picrew.me/image_maker/208041">pic crews</a> she made. The one I just linked is one we made together!!</p>
			<p>After we made the pic she posted it in our discord server, my sister was online at the time, it was really embarrassing but also funny. I deleted it. Later when we both logged off, she made a couple personal edits to the image on her art tablet to make it look more like us. She posted in the server again and I couldnt will myself to remove it because I thought the edits she made were pretty cute.</p>
			<h3><a href="pages/aboutus.html">About Us</a></h3>
			<p>This is our about us page, grape made some pretty sexy avatars.. Posting this on the main block because more people need to see grape's epic work!!</p>
			<h3><a href="pages/reading.html">User Index Essential Readings!</a></h3>
			<p>Click here to check out our essential reading list! Most of it is weird and pornographic. But some of it is actually really worth checking out lol!</p>
			<h3><a href="pages/guns.html">GUNS ARE SEXY!</a></h3>
			<p><img src="img/glitter_gun1.gif" alt="glitter gun" width="100px" height="75px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 0px;float:right">So basically, grape and I are very horny for guns, so horny that we plan to purchace one through private trade some time down the line. Anyways, we decided to try to make a page on our site dedicated to them in the future... Once it's up you can find it at the link above or <a href="pages/guns.html">here</a>.</p>
			<!--p>I have come to realize that the time we all have is temporary and soon we will lose what we call normal and what we call home. Soon we will move to the next and the new and it will be scary and unpleasant but it is necessary. There is no change without moving forward. There is no growth without leaving where you once were. We have been growing off eachother for many years now. It is about time we start shooting off into different directions. It is a shame that our time together is coming to an end. But the time spend together sure was fun. This will be my goodbye. So long, my treasured friends.</p-->

			<h1>grapetoast is really cute!</h1>
			<p>There is no debating it. The verdict is in! The well known instagram and tiktok influencer, <i>grapetoast</i>, is an absolute cutie-pie! Without a doubt, fully deserving of this role and its perks. From now on, as God Empress of the universe, Her Majesty, grapetoast, is permitted to break and violate all laws punishable by man and beyond ;)</p>
