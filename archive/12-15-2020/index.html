			<p>Welcome to the page! We are currently under construction at the moment, but more is to come as time goes on. For now, please enjoy some of the wacky content our friends and us have came up with. Enjoy your stay ^-^</p>
			<h3><a href="pages/reading.html">User Index Essential Readings!</a></h3>
			<p>Click here to check out our essential reading list! Most of it is weird and pornographic. But some of it is actually really worth checking out lol!</p>

			<p><img src="img/glitter_gun1.gif" alt="glitter gun" width="100px" height="75px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 0px;float:right">So basically, grape and I are very horny for guns, so horny that we plan to purchace one through private trade some time down the line. Anyways, we decided to try to make a page on our site dedicated to them in the future... Once it's up you can find it at the link above or <a href="pages/guns.html">here</a>.</p>
			<!--p>I have come to realize that the time we all have is temporary and soon we will lose what we call normal and what we call home. Soon we will move to the next and the new and it will be scary and unpleasant but it is necessary. There is no change without moving forward. There is no growth without leaving where you once were. We have been growing off eachother for many years now. It is about time we start shooting off into different directions. It is a shame that our time together is coming to an end. But the time spend together sure was fun. This will be my goodbye. So long, my treasured friends.</p-->
			<h1>grapetoast is really cute!</h1>
			<p>There is no debating it. The verdict is in! The well known instagram and tiktok influencer, <i>grapetoast</i>, is an absolute cutie-pie! Without a doubt, fully deserving of this role and its perks. From now on, as God Empress of the universe, Her Majesty, grapetoast, is permitted to break and violate all laws punishable by man and beyond ;)</p>
